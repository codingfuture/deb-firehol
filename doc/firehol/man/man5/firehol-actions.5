.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These actions are the actions to be taken on traffic that has been
matched by a particular rule.
.PP
FireHOL will also pass through any actions that iptables(8) accepts,
however these definitions provide lowercase versions which accept
arguments where appropriate and which could otherwise not be passed
through.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[]
.PP
The iptables(8) LOG action is best used through the optional rule
parameter \f[C]log\f[] since the latter can be combined with one of
these actions (FireHOL will generate multiple firewall rules to make
this happen).
For more information see log and
loglimit.
.RE
.PP
The following actions are defined:
.SS accept
.PP
\f[C]accept\f[] allows the traffic matching the rules to reach its
destination.
.PP
For example, to allow SMTP requests and their replies to flow:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
server\ smtp\ accept
\f[]
.fi
.SS accept with limit \f[I]requests/period burst\f[] [overflow
\f[I]action\f[]]
.PP
\f[C]accept\ with\ limit\f[] allows the traffic, with new connections
limited to \f[I]requests/period\f[] with a maximum \f[I]burst\f[].
Run \f[C]iptables\ -m\ limit\ --help\f[] for more information.
.PP
The default \f[C]overflow\f[] \f[I]action\f[] is to REJECT the excess
connections (DROP would produce timeouts on otherwise valid service
clients).
.PP
Examples:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

server\ smtp\ accept\ with\ limit\ 10/sec\ 100

server\ smtp\ accept\ with\ limit\ 10/sec\ 100\ overflow\ drop
\f[]
.fi
.SS accept with recent \f[I]name\f[] \f[I]seconds\f[] \f[I]hits\f[]
.PP
\f[C]accept\ with\ recent\f[] allows the traffic matching the rules to
reach its destination, limited per remote IP to \f[I]hits\f[] per
\f[I]seconds\f[].
Run \f[C]iptables\ -m\ recent\ --help\f[] for more information.
.PP
The \f[I]name\f[] parameter is used to allow multiple rules to share the
same table of recent IPs.
.PP
For example, to allow only 2 connections every 60 seconds per remote IP,
to the smtp server:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
server\ smtp\ accept\ with\ recent\ mail\ 60\ 2
\f[]
.fi
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[]
.PP
When a new connection is not allowed, the traffic will continue to be
matched by the rest of the firewall.
In other words, if the traffic is not allowed due to the limitations set
here, it is not dropped, it is just not matched by this rule.
.RE
.SS accept with knock \f[I]name\f[]
.PP
\f[C]accept\ with\ knock\f[] allows easy integration with
knockd (http://www.zeroflux.org/knock/), a server that allows you to
control access to services by sending certain packets to "knock" on the
door, before the door is opened for service.
.PP
The \f[I]name\f[] is used to build a special chain knock_<\f[C]name\f[]>
which contains rules to allow established connections to work.
If knockd has not allowed new connections any traffic entering this
chain will just return back and continue to match against the other
rules until the end of the firewall.
.PP
For example, to allow HTTPS requests based on a knock write:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
server\ https\ accept\ with\ knock\ hidden
\f[]
.fi
.PP
then configure knockd to enable the HTTPS service with:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
iptables\ -A\ knock_hidden\ -s\ %IP%\ -j\ ACCEPT
\f[]
.fi
.PP
and disable it with:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
iptables\ -D\ knock_hidden\ -s\ %IP%\ -j\ ACCEPT
\f[]
.fi
.PP
You can use the same knock \f[I]name\f[] in more than one FireHOL rule
to enable/disable all the services based on a single knockd
configuration entry.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[]
.PP
There is no need to match anything other than the IP in knockd.
FireHOL already matches everything else needed for its rules to work.
.RE
.SS reject
.PP
\f[C]reject\f[] discards the traffic matching the rules and sends a
rejecting message back to the sender.
.SS reject with \f[I]message\f[]
.PP
When used with \f[C]with\f[] the specific message to return can be
specified.
Run \f[C]iptables\ -j\ REJECT\ --help\f[] for a list of the
\f[C]--reject-with\f[] values which can be used for \f[I]message\f[].
See REJECT WITH MESSAGES for some examples.
.PP
The default (no \f[I]message\f[] specified) is to send
\f[C]tcp-reset\f[] when dealing with TCP connections and
\f[C]icmp-port-unreachable\f[] for all other protocols.
.PP
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

UNMATCHED_INPUT_POLICY="reject\ with\ host-prohib"

policy\ reject\ with\ host-unreach

server\ ident\ reject\ with\ tcp-reset
\f[]
.fi
.SS drop; deny
.PP
\f[C]drop\f[] discards the traffic matching the rules.
It does so silently and the sender will need to timeout to conclude it
cannot reach the service.
.PP
\f[C]deny\f[] is a synonym for \f[C]drop\f[].
For example, either of these would silently discard SMTP traffic:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
server\ smtp\ drop

server\ smtp\ deny
\f[]
.fi
.SS return
.PP
\f[C]return\f[] will return the flow of processing to the parent of the
current command.
.PP
Currently, the only time \f[C]return\f[] can be used meaningfully used
is as a policy for an interface definition.
Unmatched traffic will continue being processed with the possibility of
being matched by a later definition.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
policy\ return
\f[]
.fi
.SS tarpit
.PP
\f[C]tarpit\f[] captures and holds incoming TCP connections open.
.PP
Connections are accepted and immediately switched to the persist state
(0 byte window), in which the remote side stops sending data and asks to
continue every 60-240 seconds.
.PP
Attempts to close the connection are ignored, forcing the remote side to
time out the connection after 12-24 minutes.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
server\ smtp\ tarpit
\f[]
.fi
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[]
.PP
As the kernel conntrack modules are always loaded by FireHOL, some
per-connection resources will be consumed.
See this bug report (http://bugs.sanewall.org/sanewall/issues/10) for
details.
.RE
.PP
The following actions also exist but should not be used under normal
circumstances:
.SS mirror
.PP
\f[C]mirror\f[] returns the traffic it receives by switching the source
and destination fields.
REJECT will be used for traffic generated by the local host.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Warning\f[]
.PP
The MIRROR target was removed from the Linux kernel due to its security
implications.
.PP
MIRROR is dangerous; use it with care and only if you understand what
you are doing.
.RE
.SS redirect; redirect to-port port
.PP
\f[C]redirect\f[] is used internally by FireHOL helper commands.
.PP
Only FireHOL developers should need to use this action directly.
