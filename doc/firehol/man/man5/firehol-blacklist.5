.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[C]blacklist\f[] helper command creates a blacklist for the
\f[I]ip\f[] list given (which can be in quotes or not).
.PP
If the type \f[C]full\f[] or one of its aliases is supplied, or no type
is given, a bidirectional stateless blacklist will be generated.
The firewall will REJECT all traffic going to the IP addresses and DROP
all traffic coming from them.
.PP
If the type \f[C]input\f[] or one of its aliases is supplied, a
unidirectional stateful blacklist will be generated.
Connections can be initiated to such IP addresses, but the IP addresses
will not be able to connect to the firewall or hosts protected by it.
.PP
Any blacklists will affect all router and interface definitions.
They must be declared before the first router or interface.
