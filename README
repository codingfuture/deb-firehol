Upgrade Notes
=============
From version 2.0.0-pre6, FireHOL adds combined IPv4/IPv6 support within
a single configuration.

If you are upgrading FireHOL from a version earlier than 2.0.0-pre6,
please read the upgrade notes, here:
   http://firehol.org/upgrade/


Installation
============
If you are installing direct from GitHub, please see:
  http://firehol.org/source-install/

If you are installing the package from a tar-files release, FireHOL uses
the GNU Autotools so you can get away with:
  ./configure && make && make install

Take a look at the file INSTALL, also.


Getting Started
===============
Configuration for FireHOL goes in /etc/firehol/firehol.conf
Configuration for FireQOS goes in /etc/firehol/fireqos.conf

In the examples directory, you can find examples for both programs.

To start the programs:
  firehol start
  fireqos start

For more details on the command-line options, see the man-pages:
  man firehol
  man fireqos

Read the tutorials on the website for more information and to learn
how to configure the programs:
  http://firehol.org/tutorial/

For detailed information on the configuration files, read the manual
online, or start with these the man-pages:
  man firehol.conf
  man fireqos.conf

You may want to ensure that FireHOL and FireQOS run at boot-time. If you
installed from an distribution package this will be configured in the
usual way.

For a tar-file installation, the binaries can often be linked directly
into /etc/init.d, since their options are SysVInit compatible. A systemd
service file for FireHOL can be found here:
